## America's Gun Problem
This is a Data Visualisation Story created for the University of Southampton COMP6234 coursework.

This React app is hosted using github pages. Click the [github.io](https://clariity.github.io/AmericasGunProblem/) link to view it.

### Sources

All data sources can be found on the hosted site with links offered with every visualisation.

### Please Note

This does not contain good practise React code. I didn't even try to make it good code. There were no marks for code quality so it is literally slapped linearly in the App.js file.

I am also aware that this is a controversial topic. I was tasked with finding one or several datasets and with that data, creating a story with appropriate visualisations. 

This was the story I chose to go with as it aligned well with the data and provides a strong impact. 

I respect America's constitution and their right to bear arms according to their 2nd ammendment.
